Whether through interactive displays, storytelling, or visionary presentations, each club has the chance to connect with students on a deeper level and inspire them to imagine exciting possibilities. The goal is for visitors to experience not only what your club is today but also the vibrant, forward-thinking journey it is ready to embark on tomorrow. Design ideas can include portals and multi-layered 3D objects to reflect the feeling of stepping into new dimensions. The recommended colour palette is multicoloured—red, blue, black, golden, and grey, but you are free to add any other colours or designs that best express your club’s unique identity.\n","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/dimenzion-club-fairs-on-july/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Club Fair, under the theme “DIMENZION: Connect in New Dimension,” invites every club to showcase.","title":"Dimenzion: Connect in New Dimension","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/july/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"July","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/prototype/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Prototype","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Robotics Club of BRAC University","summary":"","title":"Robotics Club of BRAC University","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
